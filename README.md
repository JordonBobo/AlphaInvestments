### Description  
We are an online resource for quickly and easily getting information about a company 
and weather or not it might be a good investment. It only takes a moment to find any 
company that is publicly traded in the US, and then get an overview of what the company 
does, the price of its stock during the last year, and any recent news that might indicate 
its possible performance in the near future. We will be expanding to include Crypto 
Currency, Forex, and possibly Real Estate in the near future to order provide for a wide 
variety of resources to help you make good investment decisions.

### Page Description
Our home page has company info as well as a link to our stock page. Future links to be 
added once available. Inside of the stock page, empty elements are shown on the initial 
load, future page loads will automatically display the most recent search. The search bar 
takes user input and looks for corresponding stock symbols displaying them under the search 
bar. The user clicks on their specific stock and the site will generate information based 
on that stock symbol. Displayed information is in 3 sections. First, company name and a 
description of that company. Second, a chart of the last 52 weekly closing prices of that 
company. And lastly, the most recent news headline, snippet, and link.
